PlayBus
=======

An interprocess message bus.

If no bus is running then a client will become the master node.
  
If the master node drops its connection then another client node
will become the master and all other clients will connect to this.
 
This bus is designed to be run on a single host using local servers.
the server mediation is handled at the kernel level by exploiting the 
logic that allows only one process to listen on a named pipe.

This code will not work across distributed hosts as no master no
mediation is carried out. This could be extended by using a known 
distributed mediation protocol.
